# Installation guide

### ⚠️ The following commands will install the pre release versions (alpha/beta)

Run the following command to install PasarGuard with SQLite database:

```bash
sudo bash -c "$(curl -sL https://github.com/PasarGuard/scripts/raw/master/PasarGuard.sh)" @ install --pre-release
```

Run the following command to install PasarGuard with MySQL database:

```bash
sudo bash -c "$(curl -sL https://github.com/PasarGuard/scripts/raw/master/PasarGuard.sh)" @ install --database mysql --pre-release
```

Run the following command to install PasarGuard with MariaDB database:

```bash
sudo bash -c "$(curl -sL https://github.com/PasarGuard/scripts/raw/master/PasarGuard.sh)" @ install --database mariadb --pre-release
```

Run the following command to install PasarGuard with PostgreSQL database:

```bash
sudo bash -c "$(curl -sL https://github.com/PasarGuard/scripts/raw/master/PasarGuard.sh)" @ install --database postgresql --pre-release
```

Once the installation is complete:

-   You will see the logs that you can stop watching them by closing the terminal or pressing `Ctrl+C`
-   The PasarGuard files will be located at `/opt/pasarguard`
-   The configuration file can be found at `/opt/pasarguard/.env` (refer to [configurations](#configuration) section to see variables)
-   The data files will be placed at `/var/lib/pasarguard`
-   For security reasons, the PasarGuard dashboard is not accessible via IP address. Therefore, you must [obtain SSL certificate](https://PasarGuard.github.io/PasarGuard/en/examples/issue-ssl-certificate) and access your PasarGuard dashboard by opening a web browser and navigating to `https://YOUR_DOMAIN:8000/dashboard/` (replace YOUR_DOMAIN with your actual domain)
-   You can also use SSH port forwarding to access the PasarGuard dashboard locally without a domain. Replace `user@serverip` with your actual SSH username and server IP and Run the command below:

```bash
ssh -L 8000:localhost:8000 user@serverip
```

Finally, you can enter the following link in your browser to access your PasarGuard dashboard:

http://localhost:8000/dashboard/

You will lose access to the dashboard as soon as you close the SSH terminal. Therefore, this method is recommended only for testing purposes.

Next, you need to create a sudo admin for logging into the PasarGuard dashboard by the following command

```bash
pasarguard cli admin create --sudo
```

That's it! You can login to your dashboard using these credentials

To see the help message of the PasarGuard script, run the following command

```bash
pasarguard --help
```

If you are eager to run the project using the source code, check the section below

<details markdown="1">
<summary><h3>Manual install (advanced)</h3></summary>

Install xray on your machine

You can install it using [Xray-install](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-install)

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -L https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-install/raw/main/install-release.sh)" @ install
```

Clone this project and install the dependencies (you need Python >= 3.12.7)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PasarGuard/panel.git
cd PasarGuard
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv sync
```

Alternatively, to have an isolated environment you can use [Python Virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/)

Then run the following command to run the database migration scripts

```bash
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

If you want to use `PasarGuard-cli`, you should link it to a file in your `$PATH`, make it executable, and install the auto-completion:

```bash
sudo ln -s $(pwd)/PasarGuard-cli.py /usr/bin/pasarguard-cli
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/pasarguard-cli
pasarguard-cli completion install
```

Now it's time to configuration

Make a copy of `.env.example` file, take a look and edit it using a text editor like `nano`.

You probably like to modify the admin credentials.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

> Check [configurations](#configuration) section for more information

Eventually, launch the application using command below

```bash
uv run main.py
```

To launch with linux systemctl (copy PasarGuard.service file to `/var/lib/pasarguard/PasarGuard.service`)

```
systemctl enable /var/lib/pasarguard/PasarGuard.service
systemctl start PasarGuard
```

To use with nginx

```
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
    server_name  example.com;

    ssl_certificate      /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key  /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem;

    location ~* /(dashboard|statics|sub|api|docs|redoc|openapi.json) {
        proxy_pass http://0.0.0.0:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }

    # xray-core ws-path: /
    # client ws-path: /PasarGuard/me/2087
    #
    # All traffic is proxed through port 443, and send to the xray port(2087, 2088 etc.).
    # The '/PasarGuard' in location regex path can changed any characters by yourself.
    #
    # /${path}/${username}/${xray-port}
    location ~* /PasarGuard/.+/(.+)$ {
        proxy_redirect off;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:$1/;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

or

```
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
    server_name  PasarGuard.example.com;

    ssl_certificate      /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key  /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://0.0.0.0:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

By default the app will be run on `http://localhost:8000/dashboard`. You can configure it using changing the `UVICORN_HOST` and `UVICORN_PORT` environment variables.

# Documentation

The [PasarGuard Documentation](https://PasarGuard.github.io/PasarGuard) provides all the essential guides to get you started, available in three languages: Farsi, English, and Russian. This documentation requires significant effort to cover all aspects of the project comprehensively. We welcome and appreciate your contributions to help us improve it. You can contribute on this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PasarGuard/PasarGuard.github.io).

# API

PasarGuard provides a REST API that enables developers to interact with PasarGuard services programmatically. To view the API documentation in Swagger UI or ReDoc, set the configuration variable `DOCS=True` and navigate to the `/docs` and `/redoc`.

# Backup

It's always a good idea to backup your PasarGuard files regularly to prevent data loss in case of system failures or accidental deletion. Here are the steps to backup PasarGuard:

1. By default, all PasarGuard important files are saved in `/var/lib/pasarguard` (Docker versions). Copy the entire `/var/lib/pasarguard` directory to a backup location of your choice, such as an external hard drive or cloud storage.
2. Additionally, make sure to backup your env file, which contains your configuration variables, and also, your Xray config file. If you installed PasarGuard using PasarGuard-scripts (recommended installation approach), the env and other configurations should be inside `/opt/pasarguard/` directory.

PasarGuard's backup service efficiently zips all necessary files and sends them to your specified Telegram bot. It supports SQLite, MySQL, and MariaDB databases. One of its key features is automation, allowing you to schedule backups every hour. There are no limitations concerning Telegram's upload limits for bots; if a file exceeds the limit, it will be split and sent in multiple parts. Additionally, you can initiate an immediate backup at any time.

Install the Latest Version of PasarGuard Command:

```bash
sudo bash -c "$(curl -sL https://github.com/PasarGuard/scripts/raw/master/pasarguard.sh)" @ install-script
```

Setup the Backup Service:

```bash
pasarguard backup-service
```

Get an Immediate Backup:

```bash
pasarguard backup
```

By following these steps, you can ensure that you have a backup of all your PasarGuard files and data, as well as your configuration variables and Xray configuration, in case you need to restore them in the future. Remember to update your backups regularly to keep them up-to-date.

# Telegram Bot

PasarGuard comes with an integrated Telegram bot that can handle server management, user creation and removal, and send notifications. This bot can be easily enabled by following a few simple steps, and it provides a convenient way to interact with PasarGuard without having to log in to the server every time.

To enable Telegram Bot:

1. set `TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN` to your bot's API Token
2. set `TELEGRAM_ADMIN_ID` to your Telegram account's numeric ID, you can get your ID from [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)

# PasarGuard CLI

PasarGuard comes with an integrated CLI named `PasarGuard-cli` which allows administrators to have direct interaction with it.

If you've installed PasarGuard using easy install script, you can access the cli commands by running

```bash
pasarguard cli [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
```

For more information, You can read [PasarGuard CLI's documentation](./cli/README.md).

# PasarGuard TUI

PasarGuard also provides a Terminal User Interface (TUI) for interactive management directly within your terminal.

If you've installed PasarGuard using the easy install script, you can access the TUI by running:

```bash
pasarguard tui
```

For more information, you can read [PasarGuard TUI's documentation](./tui/README.md).

# Node

The PasarGuard project introduces the [node](https://github.com/PasarGuard/node), which revolutionizes infrastructure distribution. With node, you can distribute your infrastructure across multiple locations, unlocking benefits such as redundancy, high availability, scalability, flexibility. node empowers users to connect to different servers, offering them the flexibility to choose and connect to multiple servers instead of being limited to only one server.
For more detailed information and installation instructions, please refer to the [PasarGuard-node official documentation](https://github.com/PasarGuard/node)

# Webhook notifications

You can set a webhook address and PasarGuard will send the notifications to that address.

the requests will be sent as a post request to the adress provided by `WEBHOOK_ADDRESS` with `WEBHOOK_SECRET` as `x-webhook-secret` in the headers.

Example request sent from PasarGuard:

```
Headers:
Host: 0.0.0.0:9000
User-Agent: python-requests/2.28.1
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept: */*
Connection: keep-alive
x-webhook-secret: something-very-very-secret
