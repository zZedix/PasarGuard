## 🧠 Backend (FastAPI)

The backend is built with **FastAPI** and **SQLAlchemy**:

* **Pydantic models**: `app/models`
* **Database models & operations**: `app/db`
* **Migrations (Alembic)**: `app/db/migrations`

### 📘 API Docs (Swagger / ReDoc)

Enable the `DOCS` flag in your `.env` file to access:

* Swagger UI: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
* ReDoc: [http://localhost:8000/redoc](http://localhost:8000/redoc)

### 🎯 Code Formatting

Format and lint code with:

```bash
make check
make format
```

### 🗃️ Database Migrations

To apply Alembic migrations to your database, run:

```bash
make run-migration
```

---

## 💻 Frontend (React + Tailwind)

> ⚠️ **We no longer upload pre-built frontend files.**

The frontend is located in the `dashboard` directory and is built using:

* **React + TypeScript**
* **Tailwind CSS (Shadcn UI)**

To build:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Remove the `dashboard/build` directory and restart the Python backend — the frontend will auto-rebuild (except in debug mode).

### 🧩 Component Guidelines

* Follow **Tailwind + Shadcn** best practices
* Keep components **single-purpose**
* Prioritize **readability** and **maintainability**

---

## 🛠️ Marzban CLI

Marzban’s CLI is built using [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/).

* CLI codebase: `cli/`

---

## 🐛 Debug Mode

To run the project in debug mode with auto-reload, you can set the environment variable DEBUG to true. then by running the main.py, the backend and frontend will run separately on different ports.

Note that you must first install the necessary npm packages by running npm install inside the dashboard directory before running in debug mode.

Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
make install-front
```

Run the backend (`main.py`)

> ⚠️ In debug mode, the frontend will **not rebuild automatically** if you delete `dashboard/build`.
